# DnD Character Generator

This DnD Character Generator is a Python application that creates random characters for Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter, allowing players to quickly generate characters complete with race, class, traits, and ability scores.

## Features

- Randomly selects a character class (e.g., Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue, etc.).
- Rolls ability scores using the standard method (4d6 drop the lowest).
- Generates unique names based on the selected race, including a title to personalize the character.
- Displays the generated character's details in a clear and readable format.

## How It Works

2. **Ability Score Generation**: Ability scores are generated using the standard method, ensuring balanced and playable characters.
3. **Name Generation**: Each character receives a random name from a predefined set of names based on their race, along with a unique title.
4. **User Interface**: The application features a simple GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to generate and view characters with a single click.
