{"name": "", "history": [{"role": "file", "content": "Introduction to Galaxy Step\u00a9\nChapter 1\t\t\nBorn to the Rich, Poor, or Savage lands, the stars have no mercy on those too weak to handle its vast plunder. To those powerful, and or just plain lucky, the oceans of space will grant its rewards. But those too weak or unlucky, get lost in the void forever\u2026 their stories are the ones told to children to keep them in line. \n\nGalaxy Step \u00a9 is an adventure set in a Galaxy like none other. For the rich vastness of space has many things to offer the constant adventurer who takes up the cause. What cause it is, is entirely up to you.\n\nPlayers new and old of rpg games may find themselves challenged by the complexities of this system. If you have never played rpg tabletop games before, you may adapt easier, however, to those who have played many games, you may find some elements similar to what you have seen in previous, while also finding new elements that combine with them. Forget what you know, and start fresh. It's the best chance you have at survival.\n\nThe Game Master\n\tCalled the \u201cGM\u201d this master lays the setting out for the players and introduces challenges to complement the story arc being played. Whether it's a premade campaign or a homebrew one, the master knows what lay beyond.\n\t\t\u201cI use SCROLL OF SCREW THE GM!!\u201d\n\t\t\u201cDenied, your scroll backfires and you are cast into the plane of limbo where you\n \t\tare eaten by an astral wombat!\u201d\n\nThe Players\n\tHeroes, Villains, Mercs, Hunters, whatever you chose to be called, it's your game, your fantasy. The player's task is to create a fantastically unique character and battle alongside allies to complete a common goal. Your strengths and weaknesses are left up to you to determine. The mechanics of character building doesn't dictate that a mage should be weak and a fighter strong. In this world you're as strong as you make yourself.\n\t\t\u201cCome on GM your jipping us out of Job Points, ain't ya!!\u201d\n\nThe System\n\tHere you will learn the mechanics of the world, and how to use them properly. Like most tabletop games, this game requires a specific set of dice.\n\t\t12 (d6 dice) \t\t6 (d12 dice)\t\t2 (d100 dice)\t\t\n\tThe system runs mainly on d6\u2019s but more powerful weapons and spells require d12\u2019s instead, while ultimate spells, split decisions or random lists require d100\u2019s. It is good to get 2 different color sets of d6\u2019s, one set for attack rolls and one for defense rolls.\n\tExperience differs greatly from other games, in this system you will earn Job Points instead. Earned \u201cJP\u201d can be used to raise stats, Vigor (HP), Mana (MP), Power (PP), Saves, Skills, Proficiencies, and Character Abilities. Job points are essential for character development.\nJob Points\nAs in most games, the player earns Experience to level up and become stronger. Galaxy step is not the same. Here you will earn Job Points from killing monsters, completing quests, or overcoming insurmountable odds (As awarded by the GM). \nHere we will break down Job Points into two categories,  Lifetime JP and Current JP.\nLifetime JP     (WIP)\n\tThis amount dictates what you have earned over your total game time. It has no real value except to display your character progression, or Level in some cases. Galaxy Step \u00a9 was not originally designed to be a leveling system and thus levels were removed. But that soon became a headache trying to calculate player challenge rating versus monster rating, and the lifetime jp was born. If you do not wish to use this section then please skip it. \n\t\tLevel by JP total:          \tOr\t\t   CR by Dice Pool\n    Level       Job Points needed to reach \t     CR\t    \t    Total dice in pool\n1\t0 - 1000 jp\t1\tTotal dice 2\n2\t1001 - 3500 jp\t2\tTotal dice 3\n3\t3501 - 7000 jp\t3\tTotal dice 4\n4\t7001 - 11500 jp\t4\tTotal dice 5\n5\t11501 - 17000 jp\t5\tTotal dice 6\n6\t17001 - 22500 jp \t6\tTotal dice 7\n7\t22501 - 29000 jp\t7\tTotal dice 8\n8\t29001 - 36500 jp\t8\tTotal dice 10\n9\t36501 - 45000 jp\t9\tTotal dice 11\n10\t45001 - 54500 jp\t10\tTotal dice 12\n11\t54501 - 65000 jp\t11\tTotal dice 14\n12\t65001 - 76500 jp\t12\tTotal dice 15\n13\t76501 - 89000 jp\t13\tTotal dice 16\n14\t89001 - 102500 jp\t14\tTotal dice 18\n15\t102501 - 117000 jp\t15\tTotal dice 19\n16\t117001 - 132500 jp\t16\tTotal dice 20\n17\t132501 - 149000 jp\t17\tTotal dice 22\n18\t149001 - 166500 jp\t18\tTotal dice 23\n19\t166501 - 175000 jp\t19\tTotal dice 24\n20\t175001 - 184500 jp\t20\tTotal dice 26\n*Epic Leveling is possible, for this, simply add 20,000 to the previous total to achieve the next level. At every level increase the added amount by another 10,000. IE: 184,500 + 20,000 = 204,500 for level 22, then 204,500 + 30,000 = 234,500 to gain level 23. For dice simply follow the pattern.\nCurrent JP\n\tThis amount shows how much you have left after spending JP on your character upgrades. This does not reduce your lifetime in any way. It is simply used for expenditure purposes on character development.\n\tExample:\nEmeir has 1000 JP currently, she chooses to purchase a Vigor die for 250 JP. she is now down to 750 JP left, however her lifetime still reads 1000 JP. \n\n\tBeware however, Current JP is not safe from other types of depletion. The Thieves \u201cTheft\u201d abilities can steal Job points away from people as easily as snatching their purse. Also, some powerful items may require JP to unlock and use them, while item creation abilities require JP to be poured into them to create the item. \n\tEverything in Galaxy Step \u00a9 has a price, how you choose to pay it is up to you.\n\n \nCharacter Development\n\t\t\t\t\t      Chapter 2\n\n\tThe universe is a vast place, and to traverse it you need a well rounded character. Here we will go over the character stats. There are 8 stats in total and each one can be upgraded at your leisure.\n\n      Stat\t\tDescription\nStrength\tMost common among melee fighting types, this stat shows your physical power. It governs your added melee physical damage, physical attack rolls, throw range, and strength based skills. \nAgility\tCharacters with ranged attacks or stealthy movements rely heavily on this stat. agility applies to a character's reflex, defense roll, and ranged attacks as well as agility based skills. This stat is also used for Initiative.\nPhysical Health\tA required stat if you wish to be counted among the living. This stat is important for calculating wound total and wound threshold as well as adding to fortitude rolls.\nMultiply the physical health score by 2 to find the wound total, the base score itself is the threshold point at which your body is in critical condition.\nMental Health\tThis stat helps to understand a character's mental state. A low score indicates the character is unstable due to some trauma in their lives. Be it PTSD, or some other circumstance. The mental health stat is commonly used by psychics. It dictates the character's psyche total and backlash point. Damage to this score could result in negative quirks. This stat is also used for will rolls.\nI.Q.\tCommonly used by mage\u2019s, the IQ score is the character's overall intelligence. As is with physical and mental health, double this score to find the characters essence total, the score itself is the mana burn point indicating sustained damage to the characters mind from pushing past their mana limits. This also applies to concentration rolls and IQ based skills.\nWisdom\tThe characters overall learned behaviors and experiences. Wisdom applies to common sense as well as the mana base for nature spell users. This stat also applies to various wisdom based skills.\nPersonality\tThis is a display of a character's demeanor, how they act and how others may interact or react to them. If a character's personality is low, NPC\u2019s may react negatively to them despite their physical beauty, and skill ranks. This stat is crucial for interaction with others via skills. A low stat gives negatives to social skills.\nDamage to this stat may result in negative quirks. Common for Faith spells.\nPhysical Beauty\tA character's overall looks. A low stat indicates a player who is unapproachable in some way, be it hideous scars, a scary complexion, or the nature of the clothes they wear. Some clothing, weapons, and armor may grant bonuses or negatives to a player's physical beauty. After all, what are nice looks for when you're wielding a gruesome bloody sinister axe from hell? Or body armor that screams demonic lineage?\n\n\nStarting Stats\n\tThere are two ways to go about starting a character build. First, you could roll 2d6 per stat and then add in the racial modifiers. After that you may spend 5000 jp on just the stats to set them to your liking. Any leftover jp is lost when done. This does not count towards player lifetime jp.\nOption two, you may instead set all stats at 10, add in racial modifiers, and grant the player 1d6 points to place at their leisure. Players may subtract from existing stats to gain more points but cannot reduce below an 8. All points must be spent in this way to move on to the next step. \nTake heed, some stats left below a 10 may result in negative quirks. Mental health and Personality specifically. If either of these are below 10 upon character creation, please roll once per stat on the random quirk table detailed further in the chapter. If the same quirk is rolled, either roll again, or force the player to amplify the existing quirks negativities. \nIE: fear of water is rolled. Emeir is now afraid of water to an extent. However, if fear of \nwater is rolled again, she is now deathly afraid of water. Even that which is in a cup or\nBowl.\n\nPurchasing Stats\n\nStarting from 0 Stat.\nStat score\t         Mod\t         cost \t      Stat score              Mod\t\t      cost\t\n1\t-5\t100\t11\t0\t375\n2\t-4\t100\t12\t+1\t375\n3\t-4\t100\t13\t+1\t375\n4\t-3\t100\t14\t+2\t375\n5\t-3\t100\t15\t+2\t375\n6\t-2\t250\t16\t+3\t500\n7\t-2\t250\t17\t+3\t500\n8\t-1\t250\t18\t+4\t500\n9\t-1\t250\t19\t+4\t500\n10\t0\t250\t20\t+5\t500\n\n\t    Any progression above 20 is 1000 per stat point and +1 mod per 2 points.\n\n\n\n\nCharacter Health\n\tThis is presented as Vigor points. Ultimately vigor is your HP, when vigor is depleted your damage is taken from wound points. Healing damage dealt to vigor is simple, potions, rest and spells will do the trick just fine. However, healing wound damage is much more difficult. Vigor heals at a rate of 1d6 per hour of rest while Wound heals at a rate of 1 point per 2 hours of rest. Or healing can be done by potions and spells at a rate of 1 wound per 1d6 vigor it would normally heal instead. However this is normally a one or the other situation. 1 wound or 1d6 vigor.\n\tEach player starts with 6 vigor points plus their physical health modifier. When choosing to upgrade vigor points it can be done at a rate of 1d6+PH mod per purchase. Wound however, is based on x2 the PH score while threshold is the base score itself. This is calculated as follows:\n\t\tIf the PH Score 15 mod +2 then:\n\t\tVigor is 1d6+2 per purchase\n\t\tWound is 30 and the Threshold is 15\n(if this seems to low to start with, then grant players an extra 1d6 per 2 PH mod they attain)\n\tIf the player dips into the threshold, they will take 1 temporary damage to their PH score per 3 points under threshold. Once the wound points hit 0 the character is dead.\n\tTemporary Stat damage will heal over time at a rate of 1 point per 4 hours of rest.\n\nCharacter Mana\n\tIf you are using a spellcasting hero, mana is somewhat similar to vigor in regards to its progression. The player can gain 1d6+spellcasting modifier per purchase and starts with a base of 6+spellcasting modifier only if in a caster path. Mana damage differs greatly from that of wound. If mana hits 0 from a spell being cast, the caster still has their essence to draw on for spells. However, this is dangerous. Any mana spent past 0 dips into essence. Once essence reaches its mana-burn state the player begins taking vigor damage equal to the essence lost. Once essence reaches 25% of its total, the damage becomes 3 per 1 point lost as well as 1 temporary point damage to spellcasting stat per point lost.\n\tAdditionally mana cannot be replenished while the essence is damaged. The player must first restore all lost essence before mana can refill. Similar to wound, essence restores at a rate of 1 per 2 hours of rest. Mana itself will replenish over time equal to the player's spellcasting mod every hour, resting or not. \n\t\tIf the spellcasting stat is 15 mod +2\n\t\tMana is 1d6+2 per purchase\n\t\tEssence is 30 and Mana-burn is 15\n\nCharacter Power points, psyche and backlash will be detailed in the release of psychics.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCombo Points\n\tIf you play a martial hero, you may encounter combo points. These points are used to create chain attacks using your purchased abilities. Each ability will show how many combo points are needed and what roll of the die must come up during the attack in order to chain that combo into it. Combo points start at 0 at the beginning of battle and build up as 1 per round. Purchasing more combo points is possible, however these are never max die and cost significantly more than vigor or mana. If entering a martial path, the player will gain 1d6 combo points automatically. 10 minutes after the end of battle all unused combo points will disappear.\n\nKi Points\nKi can only be purchased if accessing a category that uses ki, such as the ninja, samurai or monk. Ki is treated similar to mana for the purpose of essence and mana-burn, however, ki users will use wisdom in place of the typical spellcasting stat. Ki does not gain any bonus to purchased d6\u2019s and purchasing dice is significantly higher than that of vigor or mana. If essence reaches 25% \u201cKi-burn\u201d the stat damage is dealt to wisdom and the user cannot use any ki abilities until the wisdom is healed. Additionally ki abilities require a particular wisdom score, if damage is dealt to wisdom from some other source, then some ki abilities may not be usable until the wisdom is restored. Pay attention to purchased abilities.\n\nVigor Points\t1d6 + PH mod for 250JP\nMana Points\t1d6 + Spellcasting Stat for 250JP\nCombo Points\t1d6 for 500JP\nKi Points\t1d6 for 500JP\n\nQuirks\n\tStats such as mental health and personality have the disadvantage of causing side effects and setbacks if the stat is too low. If the stat goes below 10 the player will roll once for every 2 points below they are. If they take damage that brings them under 10 or further if they were already under 10 then roll for every 2 points of damage they take to the stat. Similarly, if they take 5 or more damage at once to MH, PER, IQ or WIS then roll on this table as well, however, these are only temporary lasting 1d6 hours, or days so long as the stat damage is temporary. If the damage is permanent, then so is the quirk so long as the stat remains damaged. GM discretion. \n\tPH has its own set of quirks. Severe damage to PH by at least 5 or more will result in a roll, provided that the result of the roll fits the situation that the damage was taken. A PH stat under 10 may result in medical conditions if the damage is permanent. For every 2 points under 10 on player creation, roll on the physical chart. These deformities or medical conditions can be overcome by restoring your PH to its original score. For conditions rolled on creation, these cannot simply be overcome by increasing a score, unless authorized by GM. conditions such as blind or deaf may require an increase in the stat to above 10 and the help of a skilled healer or something. Ask your GM for their input.\n\nPersonality Quirks (MH, IQ, WIS, PER)\n\n1\tPer\tFickle\tYou have no issue agreeing to something, but you change your mind constantly.\n2\tMH\tOoh Shiny!\tYou act excited, childish and noisy when finding some form of loot.\n3\tPer\tShadow Mind\tYou tend to act shady and mysterious when around groups of people.\n4\tPer, Wis\tWise one\tYou answer questions in the form of nuggets of wisdom or as if reading them from a fortune cookie. Even if what you say doesn't make any sense or isn't wise at all.\n5\tMH, Per\tskittish\tYou are shy and bashful and tend to hide when new people come around.\n6\tPer\tgambler\tYou have a habit of placing a bet on anything that tickles your fancy, even if it's in the middle of combat.\n7\tMH, Per\t\u201cThis one\u201d\tYou talk about yourself in the 3rd person, or use the phrase \u201cthis one\u201d when referring to yourself.\n8\tWis, Per\tCrook\tYou have no issue about charging people for your help, or haggling with them about a reward. This includes your allies.\n9\tMH, Per\twonderlust\tYou constantly ask others how stuff tastes or smells, and you can't help but \u201cfollow the butterfly\u201d from time to time.\n10\tMH\tHigh Volume\tYou can't help but talk loudly or yell when you are excited or scared.\n11\tIQ, MH, Per\tKnow-It-All\tYou think you know everything about everything. You may attempt any lore check even if you have no ranks in it. However, the knowledge you get has a 75% chance to be wildly inaccurate. GM Roll.\n12\tMH\tInsecure\tWhile others deem you as polite, you are clearly insecure about yourself and your interactions with others.\n13\tMH\tApologetic\tYou have a constant need to apologize for everything that goes wrong, or even some things that go right. Sometimes you even apologize for no reason or at the most inopportune moments.\n14\tPer, Wis\tHippy\tYou are very mellow and down to earth. Some would even describe you as Philosophical.\n15\tMH\tQuiet as a mouse\tYou barely speak and when you do, you say as little as possible. Or perhaps you do speak, but it's so low that most can't hear you.\n16\tMH\tTwisted\tYou tend to laugh at carnage or misfortune of all kinds. Even breaking into a full fit of boisterous laughter in the face of mass slaughter or other such horrific scenes.\n17\tWis, IQ\tHey you\u2026.\tYou forget people's names easily and even call them by the wrong name on more than one occasion. You've even been known to do the same with some objects or even pets.\n18\t\tFaithful\tYou pray constantly. Before battle, before bed, before going on a mission, or even before entering the pub or using the bathroom.\n19\t\tCheerleader\tYou are quick to praise others for everything they do. Even if it's something small like taking a drink from a mug.\n20\t\tWho me?\tYou appear surprised or offended when people talk to you. You are always caught off guard by the littlest of things, like someone handing you a plate.\n\n21\tMeh\u2026\tYou don't like to make the decisions and don't bother with the details. When asked your opinion or decision on something you often defer to others to make it for you.\n22\tLaw keeper\tYou make it your mission to learn, follow and enforce the laws of the system on your party and those you encounter. \n23\tQuotations\tYou constantly quote random people to your party, even including air quotes when you talk about that person.\n24\tBlunt\tYou prefer to be blunt with everything you do or say, and have no problem calling others out on the \u201cReal\u201d reason they are doing or saying something.\n25\tOpinionated\tYou have no qualms about asking others for unnecessary advice or constantly giving your opinion on things. Even if it doesn't concern you.\n26\tDistracted and simple\tYou are constantly distracted by little things around you, even in combat. When it comes to jokes and metaphors you need others to explain them to you.\n27\tLearned\tYou think yourself highly intelligent and an excellent speaker. You often speak formally and use bigger words than necessary. While this helps with skills like performing, gathering information, bribing, bluffing, or diplomatic situations (+5) it can be a hindrance elsewhere causing a -5 to such skills instead. Or even causing a fight at the local pub.\n28\tBizarre beliefs\tYour belief system is unlike anything anyone has ever heard. But you trust it and believe it fully, and even base alot of your decisions on it.\n29\tFind another way\tYou always attempt to find a compromise to any and every situation. Sometimes it may not even be necessary but you will try anyway.\n30\tNumber Mumbler\tYou have a bad habit of talking to yourself and you enjoy counting things out loud, and even try to have fun with numbers.\n31\tLiar Liar\tYou are clearly a bad liar, but you try anyway, even if it means digging your hole deeper and deeper. -\u00bd to all verbal based skill checks.\n32\tAccidentally rude\tYou have a tendency to ask rude questions or say rude things without realizing they are rude. -\u00bd to any verbal diplomacy or information gathering based skills.\n33\tWhiny\tYou tend to grumble and complain about being asked to do things.\n34\tSensitive\tYou are very sensitive about criticisms and conflict. -\u00bd to intimidation, bluff, and bribe skills as well as defending against such skills being used.\n35\tAbsent Minded\tYou are clearly not here and constantly need to be pulled back on track. -10 to concentration checks, and all relations skills.\n36\tBigot\tyou have a nagging need to blame a particular race, religion, or nation/planet for all your troubles.\n37\tSmartest ever\tyou think your intellect gives you superiority over others and have no problem bullieing others with it. +2 IQ, -10 to relation skills (+5 to Intimidate instead.)\n38\tMoaning mary\tyou hate a particular terrain type, or weather type and will constantly complain loudly when forced to traverse it.\n39\tBe Prepared\tyou enjoy making a list of tasks for your party to complete every day, and have no problem reminding them good or bad.\n40\tHypocondriact\tyou constantly warn your party of sicknesses, diseases, infections and the like and are deathly afraid of contracting them.\n41\tRhyme or Reason\tyou constantly say words that rhyme with the last word that someone else just spoke.\n42\tKuwaii!\tyou make random animal noises or likenesses when your excited about something or threatened by something.\n43\tBook Worm\tyou delight in literacy and must devour knowledge where possible, forcing your party to pull you away from librarys. \n44\tSalt Spiller\t\tyou are very superstitious and find a way to weave it in to everything.\n45\tIs it broken?\tyou constantly ask why something wont work, even if the answer is obviously right in front of you.\n46\tInfatuation\t\tyou claim to be in love with who ever in the party has the highest Physical beauty score, even if it changes to someone else.\n47\tAll about the Hype\tyou constantly suggest ways to make things more fun, or exciting, even if in the middle of combat.\n48\tFrenemies\t\tyou try to \"act\" like a friend, but you obviously hate the person in the party with the Highest personality score. even if it changes\n49\tAnti-divine\tyou know the gods exist, but hate all religion and gods alike. you have your reasons and dont need to explain yourself.\n50\tNo Morals\t\tyou lack a moral compass when it comes to making plans and often propose a horrific solution to the problem at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaves and Dice Pool\n\nSaves\n\tEach player has four saves to pay attention to. Fortitude, Reflex, Will, and Concentration. Having high bonuses could save your bacon in a dirty fight. Don't forget to spend jp on them when able.\n\t\nFortitude: the body's ability to overcome severe wounds, poisons, sickness, and other such ailments as well as the characters ability to stand their ground in a windstorm or while being bull rushed. \n\nReflex: This save grants you the ability to dodge certain attacks and traps laid out in dungeons and such. A good reflex may also be required to catch a pickpocket or to rob others yourself. A sleight of hand skill is all well and fine but when performing such a task in public during a pass by would instead require a reflex and a sleight of hand.\n\nWill: will is the players ability to resist mental effects, or even stand your ground in the face of dire fear. A good will is needed if you wish to resist the effects of large spells that focus on mental constraint and damage.\n\nConcentration: this save is mostly for mages, however some fighters and knights will use it in moments of battle while attempting to hold a shield or weapon steady. If you reach your threshold in wound your body starts to shake and you will need a concentration save roll equal to your PH score to make an attack successfully. This is treated as a player on the verge of death who is still attempting to swing even though their body wants to give up. Spellcasters may need such a roll for maintaining a constant spell, or holding a spell while being attacked. Spells that take more than one action to complete may result in consuming multiple rounds, and therefore leaves the caster open for attack. If attacked while casting, make a concentration check equal to your spellcasting stat, or lose the spell and mana.\n\nInitiative: this is not a save but works on similar mechanics. Initiative is used to determine the order of turns in a given round. Who goes first and who goes last. Initiative does not have a save bonus and only has 1d6 + AGI Mod + any Misc. bonus you may have. Some spells or special effects can grant extra d6 to this roll.\n\n(Note: any purchased save bonuses cannot exceed your dice pool total+2 per save.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDice Pool\n\tThe player's dice pool is simple. These are the dice you will add to attack rolls or defense rolls. The dice pool must be split evenly or at least in 33% to 66% split. Upon start, each player will begin with one die in their attack pool and one in their defense pool. Attack dice apply to any attack skill, ability, or attack type. While defense dice apply to defense rolls, save rolls and all non combat skills or abilities. Upon purchasing at least 10 abilities from one category, the player will earn another die to their pool total. Place it at your leisure so long as it falls in the half or one third range. More dice may also be purchased for the pool. However, your pool cannot exceed more than double your level in each pool type. Meaning, at level 1 you may only have 2 dice max in attack and 2 max in defense. (Note: if you choose not to use levels. Simply reference the level chart for discovering max dice only. But if you are using CR rule ignore max limit)\n\nAttack bonuses\n\tSimilar to saves, attack bonuses apply to different attack types individually. There are 4 main attack types, Melee, Range, Spell, and Psychic. Abilities from martial and agility paths will rely on melee and ranged depending on the ability type. While mage, faith, nature, and blood paths will focus more on spell attacks. Psychic paths will be introduced in a later installment. Each attack type will need to have its bonuses purchased separately, just like saves. However, they all cost the same amount.\n\tWhen any one attack type reaches 6 points, you may gain an additional action in that type. IE: Emeir has 6 in Melee and 4 in Spell. This means she can either perform 2 actions in melee type or 1 action in spell type. But not both. This can be beneficial for spellcasters who require 2 or more actions to complete a spell. Rather than taking 2 turns to cast the spell, they have become more adept and can cast it in one instead. (Martial combo\u2019s do not count towards the amount of actions a player has. They consume combo points instead to cover the action point cost. However, if a player has multiple actions in a round they may use an action to combo attack one foe, and then use their next action to combo attack another foe. Making them a martial monster if comboed properly.)\n\nPurchasing points\nSave bonus +1\t50JP per point\nAttack bonus +1\t100JP per point\nDice Pool +1\t1000JP per die\n\n\n\n\nThe Player\n\nPlayer Actions\n\tDuring a players turn they are allotted: \n\u25cf\tOne free action (any action that can be performed in a matter of 5 seconds, such as dropping something, saying something short, or using a hand signal for example.), \n\u25cf\tOne quick action (such as unsheathing a weapon or grabbing at an item on a belt. Other actions may be deemed quick actions by the GM), \n\u25cf\tOne attack action (this is whether you choose to attack or not, this is your main action. If you have multiple actions in one of your attack types, this is when you can use them. If you're a spell caster and have multiple actions in spells you may use them to cast offensively or defensively. Even if using cure spells, this still consumes a spell action type. Skills are treated as an attack action and the player may only use one skill per turn in combat.), \n\u25cf\tOne move action (used for moving your character up to their max move range.). \n\nAdditionally a full main action (including all attack actions) can be given up to take another move action. Similarly a move action can be given up to take another quick action. However, unlike giving up a main action to move again, giving up a move for a quick can only be done once every 3 turns.\n\nStat Dice\n\tEach stat has a modifier, and these modifiers are used to give bonuses to defense, saves and skills in the form of extra dice. IE: an Agility of 15 has a modifier of 2 meaning Defense rolls and Reflex rolls receive 2d6 to their rolls. \n\nCalculating player defense\n\tThe players defense is as follows:\nArmor DB (Defense Bonus): total bonus added to the player's defense roll against attacks.\nArmor DR (Damage Reduction): total damage reduced from armor by attacks not of a listed type.\nDefense Bonus + Agility dice + Misc. Bonuses + defense dice = Total defense roll.\n(From Armor\t            (From Mod)   \nAnd natural)\n\n\tArmor pieces grant bonuses in different ways, some grant a defense bonus to defense rolls while others grant a \u201cDR\u201d or \u201cDamage Reduction\u201d. However, the player must be mindful that different armors cannot stop certain types of attacks from bypassing its DR. for example, metal armor takes extra damage from electric and fire attacks, while leather armor cannot stop damage from bullets and such.\n\n\n\n\nBasic armor\n    types\t\t\t\tBypassing Damage Reduction\nLeather\tDoes not stop bullet, arrow, bolt or energy weapons\nChain\tDoes not stop heavy bullets and energy weapons, vulnerable to Electric damage (+\u00bd Damage received)\nPlate\tHalf DR Against heavy bullets and energy weapons, vulnerable to Electric and Sonic (X2 Damage received), and Fire (+\u00bd Damage Received)\nMech\tDoes not stop Electric, Sonic, Ion, and Psionic weapons, additionally electric deals x2 damage. Hammer and axe attacks that have the crush or sever criticals will instead short circuit the mech armor for a full round. (such cuts or smashes expose wires and internal workings, causing malfunctions.) if a mech takes 3 such malfunctions it shuts down. For multiple mech pieces instead of a full mech body, roll to see which piece takes the hit.\nPower\tDoes not stop Electric, sonic, or psionic attacks. Electric and sonic deal x2 damage.\n\nArmor Type\t\t\t\tTypical Bonus by Piece\nArmor\tHead (DB)\tChest (DR)\tArms (DR)\tLegs (DR)\tHands (DB)\tFeet(DB)\nLeather\t+1\t+1\t+1\t+1\t+1\t+1\nChain\t+2\t+2\t+2\t+2\t+1\t+1\nPlate\t+2\t+4\t+4\t+4\t+2\t+1\nMech\t+3\t+10\t+10\t+10\t+2\t+2\nPower\t+2\t+6\t+4\t+6\t+2\t+2\n\n\tChain, Plate and Power receive bonus points if select pieces are connected together. For example if the chain sleeves, and chest are worn with the chain gloves, the armor receives an extra point bonus to DR. however, Mech armor is typically built to be a full body set, so it does not gain such bonuses. But, more singular pieces do exist and may have their own bonuses to armor for combining them with other pieces.\n\n\tOther materials may grant alternate bonuses and penalties. But rare metal types must be processed by the player or by a skilled smith.\n\tShields are treated differently. Rather than providing a defense bonus or damage reduction, they instead provide extra dice to the defense roll. This bonus die varies by shield type and material type.\n\n\n\nShield Type\t\tDie type\t\tMaterial\t          # of dice\nBucklers\td3 die bonus\t\tWood material\t1 die bonus\nShields\td6 die bonus\t\tStone material\t2 die bonus\nTower shields\td12 die bonus\t\tSteel material\t3 die bonus\n\n\tOther materials for shields exist, but must be found and processed by the player or brought to a well trained smith. This is the same for more unique weapons and armor. Materials will be discussed later in the ITEMS chapter.\n\nCalculating player saves and attack\n\tSaves are set up similarly to the player's defense roll, however only rare items possess the ability to grant extra dice to a save roll. Saves are calculated as follows:\n\tSave: Modifier dice + Defense dice + Save bonus + Misc. bonus = Save roll\n\t(Fortitude: Physical Health Dice + Defense Dice + Fort Bonus + Misc. Bonus)\n         The save bonus is what is added from purchasing save bonus points with JP.\n\nAttack types are just the same:\n\tAttack: Modifier dice + Offensive Dice + Attack Bonus + Misc. Bonus = Attack roll\n\t(Melee: Strength dice + Offensive Dice + Melee Bonus + Misc. Bonus)\n        The melee bonus is granted from purchasing Attack bonuses in melee with your JP.\n\nCriticals depend on the player and not the spell or weapon. If at least 3/4ths of the attack or spell dice come up 4 and above, the player may roll a percentile to see if it's a critical. If rolling 75 and above, the player gets a critical hit. Each weapon has a listed critical next to it to show what happens when the player scores such a crit. Criticals do not always indicate more damage, and in some cases apply status effects instead.\n\nCasting offense and defense\n\tWhen casting spells you may choose to cast offensively or defensively, offensive casting is as normal with no bonus or penalties. However, choosing to cast defensively incurs a -1d6 per 2 levels of the spell from the attack roll but increases defense by only 1d6, and increases concentration by 1d6 per 2 levels of the spell.\n\nAlignment\n\tUnlike most tabletop games where players pick an alignment, this game works on a point system dictated by the players actions. A player will start out at 0 on both the good and evil scale and the lawful and chaotic scale. Depending on the quests they complete, the actions they take in game and some of the categories or abilities they unlock will give them points towards one direction or the other going up to a max of 10 on each side. Counting up to 3 from 0 on each side is considered the neutral range. 0 still counts as a number for the purpose of going from one extreme to the other. This means there are 7 numbers in good and lawful, 7 numbers in each neutral ground and 7 numbers in evil and chaotic.\n\n        Neutral\nGood    10  9   8  7   6  5   4    3   2  1   0   1  2   3    4   5  6   7  8   9  10  Evil\n\t  \ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32  \ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32  \ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\n\t  \ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32  \ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32  \ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\ud83d\udd32\nLawful  10  9   8  7   6  5   4    3   2  1   0   1  2   3    4   5  6   7  8   9  10  Chaotic\n        Neutral\n\nPaths and Categories\nPaths\n\tA player's path is their Occupation or school of training they chose to enter into upon creation. At creation, the player chooses one path to enter. After that they may choose one category out of that path to open for free. This does not grant them all the abilities in that path, it only gives them access to purchasing those abilities. \n\tIf a player's racial favored path aligns with the path they have chosen, then they may unlock a second category. Some races may even grant reduced cost of select categories or ability types allowing the player to create a perfect synergy of race and occupation.\n\tIf a player wishes, they may purchase into a second path for 5000 JP, allowing them to create a cross path occupation. However, players may only have 2 paths total to purchase from. Only GM approval, epic or mythic leveling, or special means will allow them to purchase into a 3rd path. Gaining a second path allows players to build powerful combinations such as the Spell Blade by crossing Might and Power, or the Hex Blade by crossing Might and Nature. Many unique combinations exist, and if the player meets the prerequisites they can become a very powerful hero.\n\nCategories\n\tChoosing categories can be daunting. But pick what you feel is best for the character you wish to create. Purchasing new categories costs 1000jp to unlock, but there is no limit to the amount of categories you can own, so long as it falls within your ability to purchase them. Some categories don't belong to any path, and thus attaining them can be done by anyone willing to meet the prerequisites or go to the location they are taught at. Each category is titled for the abilities it performs, from the black mage casting Akashic element spells, to the priest who wields powerful healing and divine spells. This game allows the player to create their ideal class and be the hero or villain they chose to be, no matter what it takes to get it.\n\tEvery ability listed in its category will display its JP cost to purchase it, any prerequisites required to learn it, and any and all actions needed to perform it. Once the player has purchased 10 abilities in a single category, they will gain one free die for their die pool to be added to offense or defense. If a player purchases 10 abilities in every category on one path, they are treated as if having mastered that path and will gain a mastery bonus as listed by the path.\n\n\n\nDefining Proficiencies\nProficiencies\n\tEach player will start off with proficiencies based on the path they have chosen. Some racial bonuses grant extra proficiencies upon creation, while others may even provide a unique racial weapon that requires no proficiency, so long as it's that race that wields it.\nCore Weapon proficiencies\nWeapon/Path\tMight\tMagic\tFaith\tNature\tInspiration\tAccuracy\nBlade\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1\t-\nPole\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1\t-\nBow\t-\t-\t-\t2\t1\t1\nGun\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t1\nThrown\t-\t-\t-\t1\t-\t2\nBlunt\t1\t1\t2\t-\t-\t-\nWhip\t1\t-\t1\t-\t-\t1\nAxe\t1\t-\t-\t-\t1\t-\nHammer\t1\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nMagi\t-\t2\t-\t-\t1\t-\n\n\nCore Armor Proficiencies\nArmor/Path\tMight\tMagic\tFaith\tNature\tInspiration\tAccuracy\nCloth\t1\t3\t2\t2\t2\t1\nLeather\t2\t-\t1\t3\t2\t4\nChain\t1\t-\t-\t-\t1\t-\nPlate\t1\t-\t2\t-\t-\t-\nPower\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nMech\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nAccessory\t1\t2\t1\t1\t1\t1\nArtifact\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\t-\nShield\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1\n\n\n\n\nPurchasing Proficiency Ranks\n\tEach weapon requires a proficiency rank to be met to wield it properly. Attempting to use a weapon you do not have the rank for will incur a -3 to attack and damage rolls per rank missed. Armor on the other hand is different. Each piece of armor has a rank, and these ranks total up to what is needed to wear all of them proficiently. IE: if your proficiency is a 3 in leather, then you can wear 3 rank 1 pieces of leather armor, or 1 rank 3 piece of leather armor, or a rank 2 piece and a rank 1 piece. If you are wearing more pieces then you have ranks for then you will incur a -3 penalty to all defense and reflex rolls as well as all physical skills per rank missing. Shield and artifact ranks are similar to weapon ranks. They only require the rank be met to use. Unless dual wielding, then rank is similar to armor. The dual weapons chosen must total up to the rank you have, thus if rank in blades is a 5 then main hand can hold a rank 3 and off hand can hold a rank 2, or other such combinations as long as the total between ranks does not exceed 5. A feat may be purchased to allow both hands to use the same rank weapons without penalties.\nRank costs by proficiency\n          Weapon       Per Rank\t\t\t\tArmor\t        \t         Per Rank\nBlade\t\t50 JP\t\t\t\tCloth\t\t\t50 JP\nPole\t\t50 JP\t\t\t\tLeather\t\t75 JP\nBow\t\t50 JP\t\t\t\tChain\t\t\t100 JP\nGun\t\t75 JP\t\t\t\tPlate\t\t\t150 JP\nThrown\t60 JP\t\t\t\tPower\t\t\t200 JP\nMagi\t\t75 JP\t\t\t\tMech\t\t\t250 JP\nWhip\t\t60 JP\t\t\t\tShield\t\t\t100 JP\nAxe\t\t50 JP\t\t\t\tAccessory\t\t75 JP\nHammer\t50 JP\t\t\t\tArtifact\t1st rank\t1000 JP\nBlunt\t\t50 JP\t\t\t\t- Artifact Consecutive\t300 JP\n\nSkill Proficiency\n\tA player will begin with 1 rank in all natural skills, and must learn any professional skills on their own. Attempting to use a skill without the appropriate ranks incurs a -3 to the roll per rank missing. Each uses its own defense or offense die, while some can use either.\n\nSkill DC\u2019s\n\tSetting a difficulty for a situation always depends on the situation itself. If you think its an easy task then set the DC low, if it's a difficult task but not too difficult then go a bit more mid range and so on. This chart should help you get an idea on difficulty levels.\n\n\tWhen your players encounter a situation that requires a DC. check the chart, find what difficulty you want it to be, and roll the dice given there. Check your results against the average and max listing. If you think the result is too high, subtract 1 to 2 per die, or step down on the difficulty. The same is true for reverse, if it's too low, add 1 to 2 per die, or step up in difficulty.\n\n\n\nChallenge Difficulty Chart\nChallenge rating\tDifficulty\tDice roll\tAverage\tMax\n1-2\tBeginner\t2d6+2\t9\t14\n3-4\tEasy\t3d6+3\t13\t21\n5-7\tModerate\t4d6+4\t18\t28\n8-10\tIntermediate\t5d6+5\t22\t35\n11-13\tHard\t6d6+6\t27\t42\n14-18\tDifficult\t7d6+7\t31\t49\n19-22\tExpert\t8d6+8\t36\t56\n23-27\tIncredible\t9d6+9\t40\t63\n28-30+\tMaster\t10d6+10\t45\t70\n\nIf master difficulty is too easy for epic characters, add extra dice to the difficulty roll as well as +1 per die added, or change the dice to d12\u2019s. For reduced difficulties change the dice to d3\u2019s.\n\nFor unique situations a % roll can be done with a d100. The player will roll their skill, save, defense, or offense for the situation and convert it into a percent. If their result beats your % roll they succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Ability levels\n\tIf you wish to create your own abilities you will need to reference this chart. This will break down the jp, mana, power, ki, ect. Needed for an ability.\n\nLevel\tJob Points\tMana, Blood or Power\tCombo\tKi\tDual Cost\tAvg. DMG. \n(Singularly)\tAvg.

(Detailed in later installments.) but if you wish to create dual cast spells, use the dominant casting type as the higher number and the secondary casting type as the lower.\nFor example, a typical Blood spell uses vigor as its dominant source and mana as its secondary. So a 5th level blood spell would cost 6 vigor and 5 mana.\n\nPurchasing Feats\n\tAbilities, skills, and character development will only get you so far. When it comes down to enhancements that can't be met by such development, there are always feats. Great enhancements to one's skills and attributes are only the beginning. Feats are available for all players so long as they meet the proper prerequisites and the jp to purchase them.\n\tSome feats grant a significant boost to skills or saves that purchasing normally limits, while others may grant a unique ability or set of abilities. Feats do not require training to learn unless otherwise stated in their prerequisite. Feats can be found in the feats chapter.\n\n\n\nBeginning character creation\nChapter 3\n\nChoose a path\nAllow the players to browse each path and see what fits for them. This way they will know where to allocate their stats to create the best character for that path. They may choose one category from that path to unlock for free. But once chosen, there is no going back.\n\nRoll stats\nEach player will roll 2d6 per stat. They may go through all the results and place them wherever they please in the stat block. After, have players spend 5000JP on stats only, any left over JP disappears once they have finished. Then proceed to the next step.\n\nChoose a race\nSometimes the hardest part of playing role playing games is choosing who and what you want to be. The races are diverse and come from various different parts of the galaxy. If you are playing a singular planet campaign and don't wish to add other races other  than what the planet already has, then make sure to tell your players. Or you could say the odd ball is simply a crashed ship pilot or lost portal refugee in need of getting back to their home land. Choice is yours. But the players should remember that each race is geared to fit specific paths. That's not saying they can't be other paths, only that they specialize in such types. Remember to check the racial favored path. If it fits the path you're on, then you get a second category for free. If it doesn't fit the path you're on, you can always cross into that path later on and get that free unlock as soon as you open it.\n\nAdd your racial details\nEach race has its own stat adjustments, as well as special perks, descriptions, movement, and downfalls. Be sure to add or subtract your stats as given by your race and add in any other bonuses the race may have. But always be aware of the downfalls, some are worse than others and will need to be roleplayed accordingly. \n\nAdd in proficiencies and skill ranks\nAs listed in the previous chapters, there are proficiency ranks provided for all paths and 1 skill rank per natural skill. You may allot the player 1d6 extra skill points to place where they please, including professional skills. However, professional skills cannot exceed 1 rank upon creation.\n\nFill in the empty spaces\nMake sure to place your modifier dice in the appropriate spots on the character sheet. Fill in the saves, attacks, and skill locations. Each player starts with 6 vigor + their PH modifier, and they will receive 1 offensive die and 1 defensive die. If they chose a caster path then they will receive mana as well.\n\n\nStarting gear\nEach player will receive 3d6 X 10 credits to begin with. It is assumed they have at least 5 rations on them and a water skin, as well as normal clothes, a backpack, flashlight, sleeping bag, and a dagger. You may give the players the chance to spend their credits on creation to allow them to enter the game more prepared, or you can make them wait until the game starts to find a merchant and begin their adventure. Starting gear is not mandatory.\n\nGender and Sexual Identity\nGender is ultimately the players choice be it Male, Female, Transgender, Intersex, or something entirely unknown to the standard races. Be aware though that some races look down upon transitioners or dual sex people while other races may revear them as closer to the divine or more in tune with nature. This is ofcourse from a societal standpoint as is with our own society.\nSexual Identity is also entirely up to the player, however this choice doesnt have to be known by other races unless they choose to tell it. Again, Society has its opinions on such matters, as always\u2026 \n\nRaces of the Verse\n\nListed below will be the core races of galaxy step. These are not the only races in the game, but they are the most traveled and widely known. Any player with at least 1 rank in Xenology can easily identify these races by name, but no further. (unless of course, the players character was born on a star rock and hasn't seen much other than the ratkin that scurry around) \n\nHuman\nThe most widely known race among galactic travelers is the human. So diverse in their cultures that they spread throughout the galaxy attempting to make new homes and new colonies on any distant star they can find with their telescopes.\n\u25cf\tHumans have a base move of 30ft, +2 to one stat of their choice, +1 to one save of their choice and they gain one feat at the cost of 1000jp or less for free.\n\u25cf\tThey may choose any path as their favored path, but once chosen there is no changing it.\n\u25cf\tHuman Downfalls: since humans are so widespread in the galaxy other races have come to know them as invaders, bullies, know-it-all\u2019s or thieves for stealing land, planets, and territory or thinking they are better than the other races. Commonly referred to as parasites or roaches of the galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWood Elf\nOne of the most popular elven species to grace the galaxy's presence. These elves populate whatever planet permits them to reside there in hopes to grow new forests and help the land. Their skin often amber and their hair and eyes the color of the season foliage, they go where the land is most damaged and attempt to heal it again. If a race does not permit them to live there, then they will not stay. They are noble creatures with frail-like agile bodies and an air of royalty about them. Some may even call them pompous or stuck up, and even rude.\n\u25cf\tWood Elves have a base move of 30ft, +2 to AGI, +2 to IQ, -2 to PH, they gain low-light vision, a resistance bonus of +1d6 to magical sleep and enchantment effects, +2 to Item Lore for magic items only, +2 to spot, listen, hide, and move silently. Any elf made weapon can be used by an elf as if 2 ranks less than it is.\n\u25cf\tThey may choose from Faith, Power, or Nature as their favored path. But only one.\n\u25cf\tElf Downfalls: Elves are often prudish and dismissive creatures, preferring plants and trees to the company of other races. Some elves often become Xenophobic and never leave their forrest home. Seen as Frail, but nimble and sometimes stand-off-ish.\n\nHalf-Elf\nThe third most common race among the stars. The half-elf can be of various races, from half-human to half-Zangulor (often called Zanri, meaning \u201cMagic One\u201d), Half-Naljeen (see half-naljeen setup), half-ratfolk (often referred to as Velfin, meaning Vermin Elf), or half-Kitsune (called Naniko, meaning Fox Elf). These elves are more open and accepting of others since their own heritage is a mix to begin with.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Elves have 30ft move speed, they may choose the better of either race's stats, they may choose the better of either race\u2019s traits. However, they cannot pick and choose this stat or that one, it's all of one race's stats or the other, AND all of one race's traits or the other. They may choose the stats of one and traits of the other. \n\u25cf\tChoose between the races favored picks. Only get one. Favored is Might or Power.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Elf Downfalls: because they are almost as widespread as humans, they are often seen as an infestation or an abomination of their parent races. They are often ridiculed for being half-breeds and commonly suffer from the downfall of both races. Only the half-naljeen and half-kitsune are better looked upon for their elegant physic. However, this does not save them from the constant jokes for the men or sexual jabs for the women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMnt. Dwarf\nShort and stout is how dwarves are often described, with their long hair and braided beards they often make their boisterous presence known in any bar, inn, or brothel they find. Standing a minimum of 4ft to a typical max of 5ft, they have black, red, or brown hair and beards, tan to dark brown skin, and eyes of Slate, rust, orange, brown or even dark blue. Vary rarely does a dwarf have light blue or green eyes.\n\u25cf\tDwarves have a 20ft move speed, +2 to PH, and MH, -2 to Per, they gain darkvision out to 60ft, +1d6 defense die vs huge or bigger creatures, +2 to item lore for identifying precious gems, metals and rare stones, +2 to sonology for identifying magestones, +2 to spot to find secret doors in stone work. Any dwarf made weapon is 2 ranks less in a dwarves hands. Due to their sturdy builds they can carry x3 on their load score and are never slowed by encumbrance.\n\u25cf\tChoose a favored path from the Might or Faith path.\n\u25cf\tDwarf Downfalls: they often show disgust and hatred for goblinoid or orc kind and have no problem provoking a fight in even the most civilized locations. They are slow in foot and also slow to forgive and forget any sleights against them, their clan, or their kind. They are stubborn and bullheaded, but full of courage (or stupidity) who can really tell. However, it is said, if you see a dwarf running the other way, you better start running too and don't look back. \n\nGnome\nIf you like pesky little tinkering gadgeteers, then gnomes your guy, or girl. This race specializes in entertainment and technology and have been at the forefront of most space vehicles. Some may call their ways of building things a bit extreme, especially when you throw a hamster into the mix, but they seem to get the job done even if it is unorthodox. Gnomes often have multicolored hair including naturally rainbow colored, and vibrant eyes like beautiful gems with the color to match. Their skin ranges from pale to tan, brown, rust or even sandy colored. They stand typically around 3\u20192 to 3\u20198.\n\u25cf\tGnomes have a 20ft move speed, +2 to PH and Per, -2 to Str, they gain low-light vision, +1d6 defense vs huge or bigger creatures, +2 vs any inspiration abilities targeting them, +2 to spot and listen, and they may gain 1 rank in one craft or profession of their choice. Gnomes can also purchase the gnome feat Tricksters cantrips at any time.\n\u25cf\tTricksters cantrips: 325JP, must have Per 11 or higher - choose four 0 Lvl spells from power, faith, inspiration or nature for free. Gain 1d6+Per mod mana to cast them.\n\u25cf\tChoose from Inspiration or Accuracy as a favored path.\n\u25cf\tGnome Downfalls: Gnomes hold a bitter hatred for reptilian and goblinoid races ranging back since the dawn of time, but this is not to say they cant be seen working alongside one in order to complete a job or experiment. However, if the goblinoid or reptilian questions their intelligence or challenges it in any way, there will be a fight on your hands. They are often seen as overly obsessed with whatever occupation they see fit to take up, and often resort to dangerous or illegal methods of getting the job done. Sometimes, just to see what happens.\n\n\nGoblin\nSimilar to gnomes in the crafting and tinkering department, these guys manage to blow stuff up on a daily basis. Though the ones that succeed become known as master mechanics, engineers or grand artificers. Goblins are cunning, crafty and well versed in things that go boom. They range in height and build roughly the same as gnomes, however their skin colors are often various shades of green, toxic colors, mud or stone colors, and rustic to red colors. Their eyes typically contrast their skin color violently and never blend in. The usual colors are yellow, red, bright blue, or bright green. On very rare occasions some have vibrant orange eyes. Hair colors are normally black, brown, red, blond, yellow, and rarely blue. They always have their hair styled in some crazy way as a way to symbolize self expression.\n\u25cf\tGoblins have 30ft move speed, +3 to Agi, +2 to IQ, -2 to Str and PB, they gain darkvision out to 60ft, +4 to hide and move silently, +1 to Gun proficiency, +1 to Mech Proficiency, +1 to electronics operations and emissions tech skills. Any goblin made weapon is 2 ranks less in a goblins hands.\n\u25cf\tGoblins can choose Might (Barbarian only) or Accuracy (Any) as their favored path.\n\u25cf\tGoblin Downfalls: Goblins hold a lifelong hatred for all gnome kind and any sub gnome races. This is a racial hatred that has been going on since the beginning of time. But just because they hate each other doesnt mean they can't work together and possibly become \u201cFriends\u201d. But you will never hear either of the races say that without clearing their throat and stopping a bit of puke from reaching their lips. Goblins are obsessive tinkerers much like gnomes, and it is this trait that has brought a few fateful gnomes and goblins together for projects or \u201cLove\u201d thus creating the Goblochin half race. Though they tinker with things, their creations sometimes lead to criminal activity (Mostly accidentally) and get them thrown out of places quite often. They constantly suffer from ridicule and try to clean up the actions of their lesser intelligent ancestors who hid in caves and raided villages. Though due to much of the ridicule about 60% of the entire goblin race has turned to blackmarket dealings, mercenary work, or criminal odd jobs just to get by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalfling\nThe joyous happy go lucky kinderling, or halfling as the common races refer to them. They are believed to be descendants of elves mating with small fey spirits, and they see the world as a bright new place to explore and document. Commonly seen as explorers, survivalists, or even monster tamers. Halflings have a wild courageous spirit that can't be tamed. A very famous halfling known by Leffy Lightfoot has been dubbed the Irwin of space by the humans, as he explores new planets, creatures, and lost sectors of the galaxy. Halflings stand around 2\u20195\u201d to 3\u20192\u201d and resemble childlike versions of half-elf/humans. Halflings typically adorn their outfits with things that represent an adventure they have been on, like a badge of honor.\n\u25cf\tHalflings have 20ft base move, +2 to Agi and Per, -2 to Str, they gain +2d6 vs any kind of fear or intimidation attempts, +2 to all saves, +2 to spot, listen, athletics, and climb. Any Halfling made weapon is 2 ranks less in their hands.\n\u25cf\tThey may choose Accuracy, Faith, or Might as their favored path.\n\u25cf\tHalfling Downfalls: Halflings have a full name and a nickname. Their nickname is what they use around the other races, while their full name is commonly used around their own race and tells a story about who they and their family are. However, if another race asks them their full name, they feel compelled to tell it entirely, even if it takes a few hours to do so. Usually a halfling name is made up of descriptive words that express how their family came to be or the adventures they have been on. If their family came by raft on a river, then riverrafter will be added to their name. If they slew an epic beast then that beast's name will be added to their name followed by slayer and so on. They are very sporadic creatures and often go unnoticed by other races unless getting ID'd at the local pub, and will more than likely be seen as childlike in maturity and stature. They have a knack for pocketing things absentmindedly that don't belong to them and are more often than not accused of thievery, to which they take great insult. Unless they take the thieving road, most halflings find joy in exploring and gaining as many new experiences as possible.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf-Orc\nBulky or skinny humans with small tusks, skin tones are typically tinted to match their orc heritage, some are red, green, or even a sky blue, commonly brownish or orange. Hair is typically coarse black or brown, and eyes normally greens or blues. rarely will they take the eyes, hair or skin of their secondary races, but it has been seen before. If the secondary race is an anthro type race, then they will have fur, ears, tails or whatever that race provides. Half-orcs normally take more after their non orc heritage when it comes to personalities and attitude. Half-orcs are more normally half-human, but rarely are of other races. \n\u25cf\tHalf-orcs have a 30ft move speed, +2 to one stat, +1 to one stat, Darkvision out to 60ft, +2 intimidate, gain one trait from secondary race, Orc Rampage: Upon reaching 0 Wound, gain 1 temp wound point and 2d6+PH mod temp vigor points, using this ability allows you to stay up for 2 rounds per PH mod before losing all temp points and falling dead. If healed by an ally to at least 1 wound point, the temp points are still lost at the end of the abilities duration but you remain alive.\n\u25cf\tChoose Might (gain 1/3 off combo\u2019s only, no free category), Faith (shaman only), nature (witch only), or one favored from your secondary race.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Orc downfalls: often bullied by full orcs and pitied or feared by other races. Half-orcs find themselves torn between the brute heritage of their full orc blood and the heritage of their secondary race. May face even more ridicule if their secondary race is something other than human.\n\nNailo\nThey say slow and steady wins the race, it would seem whatever god created the nailo took that to heart. These creatures resemble humanoid bovines, much like frail versions of minotaurs. But they have one great difference, hiding below their robes is a short cow-like waist with four frail legs extending out from it. Nailo are a race of A-sexual beings who are believed to be the true ancients of the universe, though they deny this claim with a hint of tension as if they are trying to cover something up. When a nailo dies, their essence is scattered throughout the galaxy, combining with essence from other nailo to create a full grown new nailo on a random planet. Each nailo\u2019s essence is divided between 10 new nailo being created, granting each of those nailo shared experiences and memories to tap into. Nailo\u2019s have long coarse hair, and faces that resemble that of a horse and cow combined in the most beautiful way. They stand roughly 5\u20196 to 6\u2019 but almost always slouch making them appear 4\u201d shorter. Their eyes resemble galaxies and nebulas and they often are born with glowing tattoos of constellations and gas clouds.\n\u25cf\tNailo\u2019s have a 20ft move speed, +2 IQ and MH, -3 Str, they gain 1d6+IQ mod Mana or power depending on what path they take. (this is in addition to the normal 1d6+IQ they would gain for entering such a path.) because of their frail legs, Nailo\u2019s take a -3 to reflex, and any athletic or strength skills. Due to their birthing process, they gain extra benefits upon creation.\n\u25cf\tChoose Power, Nature, Inspiration or Faith as their favored path.\n\u25cf\tDedicant: upon choosing one of the favored paths as your primary path, you may purchase all spells at Half JP cost. This only applies to spells, not extraordinary abilities, feats, or others. You may also choose 5 professional skills to put 1 rank in and one weapon proficiency to put 2 ranks in.\n\u25cf\tNailo Downfalls: because of their frail legs, nailo don't do much climbing or running, and instead prefer to use their magic to solve the task for them. They are often revered as elders, even if just born. They harbor no hate for others, and no affections for any potential partners. They are not romantic in any way, instead preferring to be wise instructors or teachers in some way to pass on their knowledge to others before they pass on. They feel it is their mission to learn as much as possible and teach as much as possible. Because of this they will often take their party under their wing and treat them as students, and a nailo will die to protect their students.\n\nHalf-Naljeen\nThe Naljeen race comes in a wide variety of anthro species, from the Janrahmii (Yahn-Ra-Mee) fox people, to the Kuljen (Cull-Yen) cat people, Suljari (Soul-Yar-EE) bird people, and the Rendii (Rehn-Die) Rabbit people. Their planet became a popular tourist attraction and vacation spot, causing many half-breed children to come about. The half-naljeen species are normally widely accepted when mixed with beautiful secondary races, even orcs find half-orc/naljeen women attractive and will do anything to mate them. These half races normally keep their subrace appearance while gaining adornments from their anthro side. See subrace for description details.\n\u25cf\tAll subspecies have 35ft move speed, +2 Agi, +1d6+PH vigor points, +2 ranks in 2 skills of their choice. See subrace for other details.\n\n-\tHalf-Janrahmii: born to this breed, the child often has a fox-like tail, furry wrist cuffs, and even fox ears. Rarely a child is born with fox legs instead of their secondary race\u2019s leg type. Children often grow short whiskers at half maturity and they grow a patch of fox fur on their chest at full maturity.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Jan has +1 sleight of hand, + 2 hide and bluff, and +1 PB.\n\u25cf\tThey choose Accuracy as their favored path, or that of their secondary race.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Jan downfalls: due to the downfalls of their fox heritage, half-jan are commonly mistaken for a half-kitsune and have been known to be kidnapped and sold as slaves or collectors items. If it is ever discovered that they are not in fact half-kitsune they are most commonly killed and dumped somewhere. \n-\tHalf-Rendii: born to this breed, the child often has rabbit ears, tufts of fur on the chest, furry cuffs on the wrists and ankles, and a rabbit tail. Only the males grow whiskers at full maturity, and the females grow patches of fur on the backs of their hands and feet that attach to the cuffs when mature.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Ren have +1 PH, +1 athletics, +5ft to jump distance and height.\n\u25cf\tThey choose Faith as their favored path, or that of the secondary race.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Ren Downfalls: constantly made fun of with easter jokes, or the tortoise and the hair jokes. Women are often viewed more objectively and have to fight to prove themselves. Men take constant criticisms for their appearance and normally hide their features unless among their own people.\n-\tHalf-Kuljen: born to this breed, the children have cat ears, whiskers and tails. Fur cuffs adorn their wrists and ankles and their fingernails are normally sharper than usual. Half-Kuljen can be born as small humanoids or medium humanoids. Normally it depends on if one of the parents is short or not, but rarities have happened. Kuljen parents can be of small or medium size. If born small to a normal sized family, then they will be around half the height of their tallest parent. Their eyes naturally take on the cat-like pupil even if their eyes are that of their secondary race. There are no tells to know if a male or female has hit maturity.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Kul have +1 Wis, +1 athletics, climb, move silently and hide. -1 to swim due to small aversion to water.\n\u25cf\tThey choose between Accuracy or Nature as their favored path, or that of their secondary race.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Kul Downfalls: they are most commonly prissy, and have a natural minor fear of fire due to their fur, but also an aversion to water similar to their cat heritage. Much like their parent Kuljen race, they are very proud nature dwellers and are very self conscious about their looks. They will always pounce on an opportunity to bathe and clean themselves, and are often looked down upon in disgust for doing such things in view of others.\n-\tHalf-Suljari: born to this breed, children often have small wings, their hair may be entirely feathers instead or have feathers mixed in, the skin on their hands and feet resemble that of birds feet skin, and they may grow talons on their feet. Some have even been known to adopt the bird-like eyes of their Suljari parents. Some may be born small if one of their parents was also small. Suljari parents can be of small or medium size. If born small to a normal sized family, the child may reach half the height of their tallest parent. They have no tells to know if they are mature or not.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Sul have +1 IQ, +1 to fly, survival, sense motive, and one lore of their choice. They have small wings granting them a 15ft fly speed and a 30ft glide speed.\n\u25cf\tThey choose Magic as their favored path, or that of their secondary race.\n\u25cf\tHalf-Sul Downfalls: because they are half birds, they take constant criticisms for their feathers and skin condition. Much like their Suljari parents, they are untrusting to others outside their race who practice the Akashic arts (power path). Their Suljari ancestors claim the Akashic arts were created solely for the Naljeen people, and any others attempting to use the arts will only abuse or misuse it. \n\nMandridi\nPronounced (Man-Drih-Dee), They are the proud tribal lion people who worship the Ruby Emperor as their God King. These noble warriors and witch doctors stand roughly 8 to 10ft tall. Most are normally covered in savannah colored fur, while some have red, black, or pure orange fur. They have long lion tails and sport an elegant mane around their neck. To those who dishonor the tribe or themselves, they cut their manes off and banish themselves from the clan until their mane returns to full length allowing them to return with their debts paid in full. Rarely does a Mandridi get banished for good. Killing the Ruby Emperor would do just that, with a large bounty on their heads as well.\n\u25cf\tMandridi are large creatures, they have a 35ft move speed, +2 Str, +1 Per and PB, -2 Wis, they gain claws, and bite as a natural weapon dealing half strength dice damage to a minimum of 1d6 and a max of 3d6. +1 to spot, listen and survival, +3 to smell. They may run at a x5 speed if on all four legs (this does not stack with the run feat). They can perform a 2 claw and 1 bite attack at the end of a run like this, hands must be empty to do this. +1 to balance when using athletics.\n\u25cf\tThey may choose Might, Faith (shaman only), Nature, or Magic (Black or Blue mage only)\n\u25cf\tMandridi Downfalls: The Mandridi share a mutual distrust and hatred for Orcs, but they respect the Orcs honor and strength. For this they may work alongside orcs, but it will always end in a constant rivalry of who is better, faster, and stronger. Mandridi often let their pride blind them in tough situations, but will always try to bring up the morale of those around them. If they are dishonored, they will face cruel judgment from their own kind, even if not in their own lands. Orcs recognize the dishonored as well, though they do not pass judgment on them, they will however, treat them less than honorable than others of their kind.\n\n\nWeazet\nSmall and simple minded creatures, unless they are dealing with some form of technology. Weazet are said to be descendants of dragons mating with ferrets. Though none know if this is true, the weazet population will hold fast to the claim of their dragon lineage and their unique appearance will hold true to that. Weazet appear to be a ferret with wings, horns and fur color of various different dragon types. And as their appearance suggests, they can even use a breath weapon similar to the dragons they hold in such high regard. Standing on the ground, as they most commonly don't, they reach heights of 2\u20195\u201d to 4\u201d at the most. Generally though, they constantly flap their wings and stay afloat, rarely using their legs to walk around. Their eyes are the colors of gems and treasure, and they keep small hoards on them at all times. Usually tucked in some extradimensional space. Though they are not as covetous as their draconic ancestors, and will still share parts of their loot, if not for a price. Asking them to part with something from their hoard is like asking a human to part with their left arm or both eyes. But if you meet the right price, you may just get it.\n\u25cf\tWeazet have a 10ft move speed, 35ft fly speed, +2 PH, +1 IQ, they gain 1d6+IQ mod mana even if not in a magic path, they may choose from one of the below listed elements and gain a minor breath weapon dealing 1d6+IQ dice damage per 2 IQ mod, in that element. They also gain +5 resistance to that element and their fur, horns, and wings change to resemble the dragon of that element. \n\u25cf\tDraconic Elements: Fire, Water, Ice, Electric, Wind, Acid, Sand, Sonic or Star. \n- Wind does not deal damage but instead causes Knock Back 5ft per 2 IQ mod.\n- Sand deals only 1/2 damage and has a 15% chance per IQ mod to blind targets.\n- Star deals damage to the creature's mana, power, ki, or combo points if they have any. If not then it deals 1/2 to vigor instead.\n- Acid deals damage in the form of 1 PH point per 2 IQ mod. This damage is temporary and can be healed with a Cure III spell or better.\n- Electric deals 1/2 damage and has a 15% chance per IQ mod to stun the opponent for half IQ mod rounds.\n- Water instead heals the target, even if they are undead. If they are made of fire however, this deals damage instead.\n- Sonic has a 5% chance per IQ mod to deafen the opponent for 2 rounds.\n- Ice has a 5% chance per IQ mod to freeze the opponent for 1 round.\n- Fire has a 5% chance per IQ mod to give the opponent a 1st degree burn for IQ mod rounds.\n\u25cf\tThey choose Magic as their favored path and gain one 1st level spell for free.\n\u25cf\tWeazet Downfalls: Because they are constantly flying everywhere, only stopping to sit and work, or sleep, their legs are extremely weak and frail only allowing them to stand on them for 1 hour per PH mod a day, if they choose to walk on their legs, they can do so for half that time. Since their race is born to fly, they take no penalties in performing actions while flying, and instead treat the fly skill as more of a walk skill, needing to make rolls when attempting to do maneuvers or actions while on the ground. If they attempt to stand while carrying a medium load, they will collapse immediately. \nWeazet take one insult to heart above all others, if told that either of their parents was a pseudodragon or a fairy dragon they will take it as the gravest of insults and fight the person no matter the odds.\n\nZangulor\nDescription and Downfall: Outcast and disregarded by society, these magically altered humans try too hard to fit into a role to benefit others and prove their worth. Appearing as normal humans in almost every way, they hold one gruesome adornment that stands out, showing who they really are. Bones protrude from their bodies on different spots, usually horns, bone tails, bone fins on their arms and legs, bone knee and elbow caps, bone mohawks, or other variations. Not all of these are present, and it varies by each zangulor. Some have even been found to have bone wings, considered very rare and often revered among their people. The zang people only wish to be accepted and work alongside others in peace, but because of their gruesome appearance they are often pushed away by those with a weak stomach. Each subrace of zang has bones that match their magical heritage. And because of another gruesome practice, even adventurers have a hard time accepting them. When an elder zangulor dies, their body is taken to the necrocity of Alta-Vaughn to be stripped of all their magical bones and tendons. Once done, the necro priests set to work turning the parts into magical ancestor weapons for the elders' descendants. Other races view this as grotesque.\n\u25cf\tAll Zangulor subraces have the following: 30ft move speed, they gain one bone weapon from their ancestors. They are always proficient with this weapon and do not require ranks to use it. However, they cannot use someone else's bone weapon without proper ranks.\n- Bone Weapon: Choose any sword type weapon, pole arm, blunt, hammer, axe, whip, or bow. Each weapon type is made from different bone parts while whips and bow strings are made from durable magic tendons and do not snap or break unless hit with adamantine or kaldanium metals. \n- Weapon Damage: any chosen weapon only deals 1d3 + Str mod if applicable, Siphon blood upon crit restoring self for 1/2 damage dealt. At rank 2 the damage die changes to 1d6, every 3 ranks there after it attains 1d6 extra damage. The holder can choose to dump 200JP into the weapon to increase its rank by 1, per 200JP they spend. When the weapon reaches 4d6 damage, the holder may spend 1500JP and change one of the dice to 1d12. This may be done multiple times for every 1d6 the weapon possesses. Weapons color matches bloodline bones.\n-\tBloodlines\n\u25cf\tAkashic Blood: The most common of the Zang species, their bones appear white. \n-\t+2 IQ, +1 Wis, -3 PB, Choose one 1st level spell from the path of power for free. Gain 1d6+IQ mana on top of any other mana gained.\n-\tFavored path is Magic\n\u25cf\tHigh Blood: The most accepted of the zang species, their bones appear grey.\n-\t+2 PB, +1 PH, -3 Wis, Choose one 1st level spell from the path of faith for free. Gain 1d6+Per mana on top of any other mana gained.\n-\tFavored Path is Faith\n\u25cf\tWild Blood: Generations of jungle dwelling zangulors, their bones appear green.\n-\t+2 Wis, +1 Agi, -3 IQ, Choose one 1st level spell from the path of nature for free. Gain 1d6+Wis mana on top of any other mana gained.\n-\tFavored Path is Nature\n\u25cf\tRacial Feat: Dedicant\nAkashic Bloods who chose to stick to one core element throughout the power path become known as dedicants. Taking this feat requires the player to stick to one element only and not choose any others. If they do then they lose the benefits of this feat. (anti mage, blue mage, time mage and red mage do not apply against this feat.) Once taken the players bones change dramatically to fit the element. For example, if fire is chosen, the bones look chard and glow, emitting heat. If ice, they become transparent shards of ice that emit cold. And so on. Changes are up to the player, and are solely for aesthetic effect.\nDedicant: 1000JP\t\tMust have 5 spells purchased of the same element.\n\tAll element spells of your chosen element are 1 die damage stronger, or double duration longer. If not a duration or damaging spell, the player may also choose to increase spell hit chance by IQ mod again, or lower spell cost by 2 (to a minimum of 1), or double the spell's range. May only choose one of these effects at a time when casting.\n\nDuroco\nThis race of Bear people comes in three sizes. Small, Medium and Large. They scale the many types of bear species found throughout the known worlds. Typical species are koala, panda, grizzly, brown, cinnamon, black, polar, and many more. Duroco do not gain a favored path, and instead gain one of 2 categories listed on their subspecies, even if they are not on that path they still gain access to the chosen category.\n-\tAll duroco have 25ft move speed, claws and bite that deal 1d6+Str per 2 Str mod. +4 smell, +2 listen, +1 survival.\n\u25cf\tMost commonly magestone miners on distant asteroid mines, they typically succumb to Liquid Dust \ud83d\udec8 addiction, a bi-product of mining for magestones. The Small Duroco stands 2ft tall to 3\u20198\u201d at most. They have +2 Agi, +1 Str, +1 reflex, and +1 sonology lore. \n-\tChoose between Rogue or Gravity mage as racial bonus category.\n\u25cf\tCommonly found as Bodyguards, mercenaries, soldiers, hired hands, manual laborers, or fist fighters, the Medium Duroco stands 4\u20198\u201d to 6\u20195\u201d tall. They have +2 to one stat of their choice, +1 to one stat of their choice (can be the same stat as +2 bonus if you choose.), +1 to one save of their choice. \n-\tChoose between Monk or Fighter as racial bonus category.\n\u25cf\tCommonly found as Tank soldiers, heavy laborers, bouncers, or heavy mercenaries, The Large Duroco stands 6\u20199\u201d to 10\u20192\u201d tall. They have +2 Str, +1 Agi, +1 Fortitude, +1 intimidate.\n-\tChoose between Barbarian or Paladin as racial bonus category.\n\u25cf\tDuroco Downfalls: all duroco have a strong aversion to fire for fear of their fur being lit on fire, they take +1/2 damage from fire attacks. (they are not afraid of magical fire they produce and are still capable of being fire casting mages.) all duroco are susceptible to charms and inspiration effects (-3 to rolls vs inspiration effects)\n\n\ud83d\udec8: Liquid dust is a drug derived from crushed magestones, it is a highly addictive effect that gives an almost demi-being experience, but slowly tears the body apart from the inside, replacing vital organs with Akashic energy. Most miners catch it by accident while mining for mages stones. If not injected with Lily Lemon Dew the effect will take hold almost immediately leaving the victim on the floor dreaming of being a god. After too much exposure the dust completely destroys the body and turns its victim into a SIV beast. (S.I.V. Sonal Ingested/Injected Virus) if used in tiny amounts, an addict can be strung out on liquid dust  for the rest of their life before becoming a beast.\n\nCharacter Background\n\tThis section assists in helping players build a backstory while granting special perks.

Natural skills are the skills people learn when growing up like how to climb, be a bully, stop a fight, hide from bullies, ect. Each of these learned experiences growing up gives us the experience to use such skills to our advantage later on in life. \nProfessional skills are things that require others to teach us, without being trained in such skills we can only hope to do something great at the risk of utter failure. In order to learn such skills, the player needs to find a school, college, or a mentor of some kind. Professional skills cannot just be learned on the spot in the middle of the woods from an epiphany ya know. It's good to visit towns often and search out good tutors and mentors to help with skills, abilities and even feats. Players may even learn from purchased or discovered books, books will have a max rank they can help the player attain.(For faster game play you may allow players to purchase what they like)\nFor this reason, players should specialize in skills that the party doesn't have. This makes them valuable to the team and allows them to be a mentor for another player if necessary. However, they can only mentor up to the rank they have and no more.\n\tAny skill attempt without the appropriate ranks will take a -3 per missing rank. Some situations will not dictate what skill level is required to perform the task, so it is up to the GM to figure this out. All skills require offense or defense dice as part of their formula to roll, However, some list \u201cE\u201d as their required die. This means they can use Either offense or defense die for the job, whichever is more relevant to the situation. In the case of athletics, tumbling through a foe's space would obviously use offense, while trying to jump over a hole would instead use whichever is better. Even further, attempting to roll past a trap would use defense. Be sure to check with your GM on what they feel is appropriate for the situation at hand. If a player can find a way to use a defense only skill in an offensive manner, then let them attempt it with their offensive dice instead. Dice are not restricted and are ultimately GM discretion.\n\nJob points and Max Skill Ranks\n\tSkills may only attain a max rank equal to x2 your max pool. The further your pool increases the more ranks you can put into skills. Select feats will change this allowing certain skills to reach even higher ranks without the pool being increased. But these only apply to 1 or 2 skills per purchase, or an entire stat type skill per purchase. Both are costly.\n\tIt is a good idea to award a player JP for using skills appropriately, if a player executes a skill properly, award them 5 to 10 JP for it. If they executed it excellently, award more. JP does not have to be awarded for skill use, especially if the player is JP hungry and only using the skills to get more. However, it is recommended to award points.\n\nCluster Skills\n\tThis refers to skills that are a parent for a list of subskills. Things like Craft______ or perform_____ and the like. Each of these skills require that you purchase them separately. A player can learn as many performances, crafts, and such as they like. However, the profession skill only alots 2 purchases.\n\nSkill DC\u2019s\n\tWhen setting up a skill difficulty, take into account the situation and add +5 to the difficulty success rate for every difficulty the player faces. Or -5 if it is an easy situation.\nFor example, John wants to identify the mysterious elf girl in front of him. For this the DC could be as follows:\nXenology check: Identify elf Difficulty 10 at most, +5 for non-standard elf, +5 for not being native to the current solar system, +5 for no knowledge of any elf subspecies by the player. Totaling a 25 difficulty to identify the Elven girl.\nIf John had prior knowledge of other subrace elves, he could draw on that to get a close approximation of what the current elf could be. This could alleviate the +5 DC, or even aid him in the matter by further granting a -5 DC instead. If John carried a book of elves, he could then reference it and gain even further DC reductions in the situation.\n\nNatural Skills\nSkill\tDie\tStat\tDescription\nAthletics\tE\tAgi\tThis is the players ability to tumble through enemy spaces, cartwheel or backflip away from danger, and many other physical feats. This skill also governs a players acrobatics, such as their ability to balance themselves and keep from falling in a tight situation.\nBluff\tO\tPer\tA player's ability to talk their way out of a situation or into one. Bluffing requires a good personality score.\nClimb\tD\tStr\tThe ability to climb odd objects, steep cliffs or even a huge creature, climbing requires a good strength and in some situations may need synergy with athletics to keep from falling in such situations.\nDiplomacy\tD\tPer\tA person\u2019s ability to bring peace in a hostile situation, barter and haggle prices over goods, and possibly even convince a contractor to grant a higher reward for a completed quest. Possibilities may be endless for diplomatic people, but a high personality is a requirement to get what you really want.\nDisguise - Appearance\tD\tPB\tUsing this skill allows the player to change their hair, makeup, and general physical appearance to allow them to pass as other people, and possibly races, or to avoid being recognized in a hostile land.\nDisguise - Voice\tD\tPB\tChanging one's voice can be difficult. But with the right work and practice, the player may even be able to imitate that mean old nasty orc captain that prowls around the grunts. This skill is a requirement for the ventriloquism feat.\nDisguise - Outfit\tD\tPB\tChanging one's appearance only goes so far, when changing an outfit your likelihood of evading capture is greatly reduced. Using this skill a player may be able to create outfits to infiltrate a location, or even escape from one.\nEscape Artist\tO\tAgi\tA skill relied on heavily by rogues and thieves for picking locks, and freeing themselves from bindings. This can also be used by others attempting to break free from an enemies arm, or that slimy tentacle that keeps coming out of the water!\nFlying\tE\tAgi\tThis skill governs how a player may fly with wings, jets, or special powers. This does not include piloting a craft in any way.\nMedical\tD\tWis\tA skill for applying bandages, setting broken bones, or identifying the poison your ally just drank and finding a remedy. Medical does not replenish vigor but covering wounds will allow a player to replenish vigor quicker. However, a good medical practitioner may be able to replenish wound points if skilled enough.\nIntimidate\tO\tPer\tThe ability to overwhelm a target with your mere presence or hostile roar. A proper intimidation can demoralize an opponent, cower a target into submission, or even cause creatures to run in fear.\nItem Lore\tD\tIQ\tUsed by merchants, thieves, and traders of all kinds. This allows the player to identify the value of an object simply by inspecting it. Average people may miss significant detail and will price an object low, while a skilled investigator can see such details and knows the object's value. Careful not to get ripped off in the evermarket.\nSenses - Spot\tD\tWis\tA player's visual perception. The ability to notice things that others may not see, like spotting that elf hiding in the tree just ahead ready to jump you!\nSenses - Listen\tD\tWis\tA player\u2019s Audible perception. The ability to hear footsteps coming down the hallway, or hear tumblers click in a lock. A good rogue may even use this to crack a safe.\nSenses - Touch\tD\tWis\tA player\u2019s Tactile perception. Some may find this skill useless, but when feeling around behind a bookshelf for a button, or feeling your way down a dark hallway for a door, lever, or torch, it's gonna come in handy!\nSenses - Taste\tD\tWis\tA player\u2019s Taste Buds! By having good taste, a player can identify what is in some foods or drinks, as well as identify unusual potions or poisons without hurting themselves too badly.\nSenses - Smell\tD\tWis\tA player's ability to pick up on scents in the air. Whether its wet fur, sulphurous fumes, or even a leak in the gas lines. Having a good sniffer comes in handy.\nPerceive Motives\tD\tWis\tIdentifying hostile or peaceful intent in others, including animals or beasts. Being able to perceive motives and intentions may be what saves a player's life when that deranged lunatic comes into the post office behind them.\nMove Silently\tD\tWis\tThis skill is how well the player can sneak up on a target, or pass down a hall without being heard. You wanna crawl through the ventilation ducts to escape, having a good move silently keeps you from being heard up there.\nHide\tD\tWis\tMoving silently isn't always the key to getting a drop on a foe or escaping from one. Your ability to hide matters. If you think holding a flower up in front of your face is going to suddenly make you invisible? Think again. With this skill you know how to hide and what to hide behind. Or even how to create a blind to hide in.\nWhisper\tD\tWis\tSome people think whispering is easy and no big deal. How many times have you had to shush your buddies who are whispering loudly?? To many to risk your life on. That's for sure. This skill trains a player to keep their voice at that perfect level that elven ears wont even pick up.\nSurvival - Urban\tD\tWis\tYou think surviving in the wilderness is hard? Try surviving the city sprawls or back alley muggings! This skill helps you identify locations and buildings in the city, as well as how and where to gather information. And it may help you to know what street not to travel at night.\nSurvival - Wilderness\tD\tWis\tThink you know your way around the forest or jungles? This skill helps in identifying unique plants, local animal habits, or even what mushrooms not to eat when you're foraging for your next dinner.\nSwim\tE\tStr\tSink or swim. Simple concept. Without a good swim skill how do  you hope to survive the rapid current? This skill also helps in attempting water combat or deep diving expeditions.\nXeneology\tD\tIQ\tAHH! Aliens! No wait\u2026 it's just a fairy dwarf\u2026 this skill helps in identifying species and races other than your own. A high skill may even allow you to partially communicate with such races without proper linguistics.\n\nE = Either\t\tO = Offensive\tD = Defensive\n\nPassive perception is granted to all players, it is assumed that while in unfamiliar territory the average person is more on guard.\nTo know a player's passive perception simply add 6 to the minimum roll a player could get with that sensing type.\nIE: if the player's Sense Listen is 1d6(Wis) + 1d6(Defense) + 1 rank + 1 racial bonus they would have 6 + 4 making a passive perception of 10.\n\nAll skill ranks are 25JP each. Even Professional Skills.\nSkills listed as Either die varies by situation. For example, if using athletics to tumble through a foes space, use offense dice. If attempting to balance on a ledge or something not involving combat, use defense. However, if attempting to balance on a ledge while fighting or being fired at, use offense instead with a -5 penalty. Any skill that gets used in combat will use offensive dice. Even if listed as defense. Attempting to diplomacise with a foe in the middle of a fight, will use offense dice with a -5 penalty since the odds are stacked against the player in such a situation.\n\nPower Gaming\n\tTo prevent high level players from passing every skill check with ease due to large amounts of dice, the GM should consider making the skills a percentile check instead. This means instead of rolling large amounts of dice, the player would instead roll a d100 and add their stat mod, skill rank and any misc. Bonuses to the roll. That is their percent chance at passing the check. The GM should set a reasonable percent to pass or roll one with whatever situational modifiers that need to be added or subtracted. This keeps powerful players from simply passing every check.\n\n\n\n\nSynergy Skills\n\tWhen attempting to use 2 skills or more in a synergy, there are 2 options you can attempt, use whatever works better.\n\tFirst, roll all stat dice, even if they are the same stat for each skill, then roll the appropriate offense or defense dice once, (not once for each skill, once total) then add all appropriate ranks and misc. Bonuses from each skill. Finally divide the total number by the number of skills used in the synergy. The result is the players success or failure.\n\tSecond, the player could simply roll all skills separately and take a -1d6, per total skill in the synergy, to the total score. GM should roll the penalty dice.\n\nProfessional Skills\n\nProfessional Skill\tDie\tStat\tInfo\nPerform___________\n(can be natural and professional)\tE\tWis\tThis is a parent skill for many other skills, perform could be anything from dance, to singing, or even aerial maneuvers. Some perform abilities may require training to get past the self taught mark. Usually a player can reach 5 ranks max in a Natural perform before needing someone to train them further as a more professional skill.\nCraft_____________\tE\tIQ\tThis is a parent skill for all the different things players can craft. The reason it is set for Either dice is because if a player can manage to craft a makeshift weapon or armor from what's around them while in combat then they should be using offense instead. Ballistic and siege weapons require offense to build while in the battlefield.\nElectronics operation\tO\tIQ\tUsed for hacking or otherwise offensive maneuvers on devices or the internet. Attempting to break a firewall or stop a firewall from falling, hacking a drone or someone\u2019s data stream device are only a few of the actions that can be performed with this skill.

This skill may also be used in conjunction with handle substance for the purpose of collecting poisonous herbs and such. When doing so it is assumed the player will spend 1 hour per rarity of the item to collect enough to weigh 1 pound. If the item itself is one pound then that means the player will only collect 1 per use of this skill. If the item weighs more than a pound then the player will be spending the amount of time required for 1 pound X the number of pounds in the item.\nFishing\tE\tWis\tFishing is patients and time consuming. Difficulty is based on location, fish type, and planet type. Some difficulty can be reduced by having good fishing tackle that is custom to that fishing environment.  It is assumed the player is spending more than 3 hours at this task to pull in 3 + Str mod average sized fish. If the player rolls any 6\u2019s in performing this task the GM should roll a % per 6 rolled. 75 and above means the player needs to roll an offensive roll on this task to land a big catch or trophy fish. Value and weight of fish is up to GM and may even require an attack roll to subdue the fish upon reeling it in.\n\nMore skills can be added at any time by the player or the GM.

From here, the player can build into their path better by taking on minor abilities that may benefit their character's future. A GM may even decide that all players must start out as a novice before entering their chosen path.\n\nName\tJob Points\tLevel\tCost\tInfo\nEncourage\t100\t0\tFull action\tUse Diplomacy to encourage all allies in ear shot who are not deaf, DC 10 to grant all allies a +2 to offense and defense rolls.\nDiscourage\t100\t0\tFull action\tUse Bluff to discourage all enemies in ear shot who are not deaf, DC 12 to cause -2 to foe offense and defense rolls.\nBandage\t100\t0\tFull action\tUse Medical to stop bleed effects and restore 2 vigor to your ally.\nRoar\t100\t0\tMove action\tBy letting loose a mighty roar you boost your next amount of damage by +2, applies to damaging spells as well.\nMight Specific\tJob Points\tLevel\tCost\tInfo\nFocus\t100\t0\tFull action\tGain 1 Combo Point next turn in addition to the combo point you naturally gain each round.\nSquires Oath\t200\t1\tPassive\tAs a squire you swear fealty to your allies and will protect them at all costs. when attacking a foe that an ally is also fighting, gain +1 cp on the first hit, if that foe dies by your hand gain +1 cp and +3 temp vigor points that last for 3 rounds.\nCaster Specific\tJob Points\tLevel\tCost\tInfo\nDraw Power\t200\t1\tFull action\tDraw and restore 3 Mana from the Akashic realm.\nNovice Missile\t100\t0\tSpell Attack\tNovice missile consumes 1MP to cast a small magic ball of non elemental energy up to 15ft dealing 1d3+Mod damage.\nSkill Specific\tJob Points\tLevel\tCost\tInfo\nSkill Boost\t100\t0\tFull action\tBy concentrating for a full round, you gain +2 to the next skill used.

Feats may be purchased by anyone so long as they meet the prerequisite listed on that feat.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nThe Art of Combat\nThe standards required in basic combat are as follows. When announcing an attack, choose the attack type you wish to use, be it Melee, Range, Spell or Psionics. For the moment we will be sticking with Melee and Range. \nFor Melee, designate the target of your attack. Once done you will roll your offensive dice, followed by your Str dice and melee bonuses. The foe will roll their defensive dice, Agi dice and any other defensive bonuses they may have. The highest roll wins and the damage is either dealt or isn't.\nWhen using range however, there is a unique difference. Ranged weapons have a set amount of Feet they can fire in basic combat. However, the shooter can choose to use what's known as a weapons max range before making their shot. Max range is x3 the standard range. This means that a weapon with a 30ft standard range has a max range of 90ft. This can be a plus in some cases, but there is a drawback. For every 15ft over the standard range, your attack takes a penalty of -1d6 to hit. Additionally your damage dealt upon hitting a target in the max range category, is reduced by 3 per 15ft. Some ranged weapons may have an even further max range due to the type of weapon it is or because of an upgrade or scope attachment. There is even the possibility of removing or lessening the damage reduction with such upgrades.\n\nEquipping your Character\n\nArmor\nLeather: Does not stop bullets, arrows, bolts or energy weapons.

Basic functions require 1 battery charge to be locked per piece in order to function and operate for a full 24 hours of non-strenuous activity. Combat is considered strenuous activity as well as anything deemed so by the GM. in combat, each piece consumes 1 charge per 5 rounds. If using a full suit, simply add all the charges together, and subtract 1 per piece from the total each round. Each piece of power armor has its own unique effects that may or may not consume more charges. Be aware of this. Each piece is roughly 120 cred per, Depending on the Vendor. Cannot cast from within a full suit. Each piece interferes with casting, causing a -5 per piece. Activating armor abilities is a move action each.

(such cuts or smashes expose wires and internal workings, causing malfunctions.) Criticals from electricity will also cause malfunctions. if a mech takes 2 such malfunctions it enters a minimal operations setting and has a 25% chance per round to shut down. At 3 malfunctions it has a 50% chance per round. Upon 4 malfunctions it shuts down. For multiple mech pieces instead of a full mech body, roll to see which piece takes the hit. Upon shut down the mech is inoperable. Each piece has minimal operations listed. Repairing Mech armor requires 1 hour per malfunction.\nMech armor often comes in full suits, but mech pieces can be found and used separately if listed as such. Mech armor increases its wearers size category by 1. damage dealt by hands and feet however, is treated as 2 size categories bigger due to strength of the hit from the suits added size and power. This allows the player to wield weapons 1 size category bigger than them as if they were normal, or 2 handed normal sized weapons can be wielded as 1 handed instead. As a suit, batteries are stored in the chest piece and supply power to the whole suit as one unit. -10 charges per day as a suit for basic functions. -10 per minute if under strenuous functions.

This includes wrecker suits, construction suits, war suits, and even the golem suit upgrade allowing the suit to operate on its own.\n\nWeapons\n\nWeapons are separated into categories, listed by proficiency. Any weapon listed with \u201cheavy\u201d next to it requires a greater strength to wield it. All listed prices are the general cost by rank and damage of the weapon. However, some vendors on different planets may have higher or lower prices depending on the rarity of the weapon. \nSome weapons may be listed with 2 different proficiency types. This means the weapon can be used in one of 2 ways or both ways if both proficiencies are met. For example, a dagger is listed as a rank 1 blade or rank 2 thrown, if you do not have blade ranks, then this weapon is only proficient if you throw it, but using it in melee combat will incur non proficient penalties. The same goes for the reverse, if you only have blade and no thrown proficiency, then throwing the blade will result in non proficient penalties. However, if you have both, then you may use it in melee or thrown without penalty. These weapons will be listed in their own category to avoid confusion. \nWeapons listed with (+#) after their damage, indicates a weapon that can be one handed or 2 handed, if wielded with 2 hands the parentheses number is added to the damage.\n\nTypical Price guide for non listed weapons or personally created weapons: 5 cred per 3 max damage dealt, plus 25 cred per rank over 1. If it is treated as an artifact weapon, add 1000 cred per artifact rank required. See artifact for more details.\n\nEach weapon has  a listed amount of slots, these slots can hold Mage stones, Enchantments or other socketable items like Rune cards, Jewels, Ect. a weapon will typically have 1 slot per 4 max natural damage it does. This does not include damage from criticals, stat modifiers, or anything added from things in the sockets. Some epic, or legendary weapons may not have as many slots as its damage would dictate it should have. This is because the weapon is already powerful, and adding more enchantments or enhancements to it would only cause an overpowered weapon. However, master smiths can add another slot or 2 to a weapon or armor for a price. Typically the price is 25% of the items total cost. Adding slots comes at a risk, for every slot added over the base amount, the weapon has an incremental 10% chance of breaking. Most smiths will only add up to double the original amount of slots on the weapon but can be persuaded otherwise. \nAlternatively, there are weapons and armor out there that have the Faucetted special feature. This means the weapon has already been designed with 3 slots to every one slot it previously had. Faucetted items can still be enhanced with more slots, treating the faucetted feature as its new original base amount of slots. However, adding more slots to a faucetted item incurs an incremental 20% break chance and most smiths will not risk it without payment up front with signed consent from the owner that it is not the smiths fault if it breaks. Faucetted is an ancient technique unknown to new age smiths. It cannot be purchased as an upgrade.\n\nBlade\nItem\tPrice\tRank\tSlots\tInfo/Critical\nShort sword\t35 C\t2\t1\t1d6+Str, Crit inflicts an extra 1d3+1/2 Str damage, light weapon, 2LBS\nScimitar\t37 C\t2\t2\t1d6+2+Str, Crit minor bleed (2) for 3 rounds, One handed, 4LBS\nSickle\t37 C\t2\t2\t1d6+2+Agi, Crit minor bleed (1) for 6 rounds, One handed, 3LBS\nLongsword\t91 C\t3\t2\t1d6+4+Str, Crit inflicts an extra 1d6+1/2 Str damage, One handed, 5LBS\nKatana\t122 C\t4\t3\t1d12(+2)+Str, Crit Critical Bleed (1d6) for 3 rounds, 1 handed or 2 handed, 5LBS\nBastard Sword\t122 C\t4\t3\t1d12+2+Str, Crit inflicts an extra 1d6+1/2 Str damage, Heavy (Str 12), Hand and a half, 7LBS\nBroadSword\t151 C\t5\t4\t1d12+4+Str, Crit inflicts an extra 1d12 damage, 2 handed,Heavy (13Str), 8LBS\nFalchion\t151 C\t5\t4\t1d12+4+Str, Crit Critical Bleed (2d6) for 2 rounds, 2 handed,Heavy (13Str), 8LBS\nGreat Sword\t182 C\t6\t5\t3d6+2+Str, Crit Critical Wound (1d6) for 2 rounds, 2 handed, Heavy (13Str), 9LBS\nGreat Cleaver\t211 C\t7\t5\t3d6+4+Str, Crit Sever Limb, 2 handed, Heavy (13Str), 10LBS\n\n\n\nPole\n\nItem\tPrice\tRank\tSlots\tInfo/Critical\nQuarterstaff\t C\t1\t1\t1d3+Str (2 ends), Crit has a chance to trip the target if they fail their reflex save. 2 handed.

Its abilities are as follows:\nMage Bolt I:       5JP       Mage Bolt II:       15JP\nMage Bolt III:   25JP       Mage Bolt IV:     50JP\nMage Bolt V:  100JP      Grand Bolt:       200JP\nMulti Missile:  +1/3JP per missile, Rounded Down (cannot use with grand bolt)\nThe sword must be swung to sling the Bolts out, while the hammer must be struck against a surface to release the bolts like sparks. Striking a foe still counts in either setting.\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\t C\t\t\tLBS\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti Proficient weapons\nCost is set to its original creation type.

These are the most common. Players do not need to be any specific alignment to follow a deity, however, if the deity commands that their followers be specific, then that deity will not hear the prayers or calls of a player who isn't. This includes any spells or abilities that directly involve the deity.\n\nKylinna Starfyr, Ancient Aeon Goddess of the stars\n\nArius Paro, Half-Human/Half-Demon God of fire and Half-breeds\n\nAregon Des\u2019Diel, Half-Dark Elf/Half-Elf God of Misfits, rebels and outcasts\n\nPolen, Lady of Flames, Half-Ifrit/Half-Human Goddess of the molten heart, fire and justice\n\nLydia Omaria, Nymph Goddess of the waters depths\n\nOma-Rali, Halfling Goddess of the Harvest\n\nSorianna, Sea Spirit Goddess of piracy, plunder and sea monsters\n\nZinch, Nivyoch God of love and war\n\nMaduan Kliech, Ancient Alien God of the monster forge\n\nHakrim, Lougen God of the master forge\n\nGrennel, Rat-kin God of deceptive courage and trapping\n\nBeukellious, Amorphiad Demon God of toxic plagues, bile and sickness\n\nGranora, Wood Elf Goddess of nature and demon hunting\n\nKatchina, Elderling Goddess of mischief and despair\n\nMalik, Half-Elf/Half-Demon King of the Crossroads\n\nWilhelm Bonneville, Human God of travelers, The brash soldier, protector of fallen gunmen\n\nZolesh, Unknown Race, many faced god of arcane magic and transformation\n\nZallanna Limbo, Aeon Goddess of chaos and randomness\n\nAuthina, Nymph Goddess of lust\n\nHal-Vera, Aeon God of Creatures, Protector of Dens\n\nConnel Everson, Human God of hopes and courage\n\n\nDefining Combat\n\n\tWhen announcing an attack, choose the attack type you wish to use, followed by the target of the attack. Roll your offensive dice and stat dice then add your attack type bonuses to the roll. Your target will then make a defensive roll while adding their defense bonuses vs your roll.\n\tExample:\n\tJohn attempts to attack the kobald in front of him. He rolls his offensive dice and Str Dice then adds his melee AB to the result:\n\nMelee AB 2 + off dice 2d6 + Str dice 2d6 = results (in this case we will use the average of 14)\n\n\tThe kobald attempts do defend the incoming attack. He rolls his defensive dice and Agi dice and any dice added by shields, then adds his defense bonus to the roll. Defense bonuses can come from armor, natural armor, enchantments or anywhere else.\n\nDB 3 + Def dice 2d6 + Agi dice 1d6 + Shield 1d3 = results (in this case we will use the average of 13.5 rounded down to 13)\n\nJohns attack was successful and he then gets to deal his damage. His weapon states it deals 2d6 + Str damage. His str mod is 2 making the damage 2d6 + 2 (average of 8) \nThe kobald has a DR (damage reduction) of 3, so 8 - 3 = 5. The kobald takes 5 damage.\n\n\tIf john decided to use a spell instead the formula would be as follows,\n\nSpell AB 3 + off dice 2d6 + spell casting stat dice (in this case we will use IQ for a Mage) 1d6 = result (using average for this example would be 12)\n\n\tIf the spell is a normal damaging spell the kobald would use its normal defensive roll as shown above. But if the spell is instead one that inflicts a status effect, or requires a save for \u00bd damage, the kobald would instead be making a savings roll. The DC (difficulty) to beat the spell in this case would be 12 (the result of johns spell roll). \n\nFort save bonus 1 + def dice 2d6 + PH dice 1d6 = result to avoid or take half damage of spell. (average in this case would be 10 indicating that the kobald failed to avoid the spell)\n\tJohn would then roll the damage dealt if it was a standard spell. Or the kobald would take whatever status effect was inflicted. If the spell deals damage, DR still applies unless the spell states otherwise. If the spell or ability is a poison of some kind, these normaly require a percentile roll to succeed or fail.\n\nSpider venom - Injury type, DC 25% chance upon injury to sicken target after 3 rounds. Upon reaching the 3rd round the target becomes sickened for 1 minute.\n\n\tThis means if john succeeds on a standard weapon attack against the kobald with this poison on his weapon then the kobald must roll a d100 if the result of the dice is 1 through 25 the kobald is poisoned. However, the kobald can reduce this risk naturally from its fortitude bonus + its PH bonus. In this case the kobald\u2019s for bonus is 1 and its PH mod is 1 giving it a total of 2. This reduces the poison chance by 2% making it so johns poison only has a 23% chance to poison the kobald instead. Some feats and skills allow you to reduce the risk of getting poisoned, or increase the chance that you poison others. But this is always calculated in percentiles.\n\nAttacks of opportunity\n\tLike most tabletop rpg games, attacks of opportunity are relevant and a much needed boon in some situations or a bane in others if your not paying close attention.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "summarize Galaxy Step?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I couldn't find any information on \"Galaxy Step\".
